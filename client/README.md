Taskmate - Full-Stack App
Taskmate is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps users manage multiple personal tasks. It includes features like a to-do list, budget tracker, weather app, notes app, and user authentication, all in one app.

Features
User Authentication: Users can log in and log out securely, with JWT-based authentication.
To-Do List: Track daily tasks and organize your to-do list.
Budget Tracker: Manage personal budgets and keep track of your expenses.
Weather App: Check the weather forecast based on your location.
Notes App: Save important notes for easy access.
Real-Time Updates: Some features (like notes) may support real-time updates.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js for building the user interface, styled using Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for building the RESTful API and handling HTTP requests.
Database: MongoDB for storing user data and app-related information.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Passport.js for handling user login and session management.

Additional Notes
Authentication: JWT is used for secure user authentication. You can register, log in, and access protected routes after logging in.
State Management: React's useState and useEffect are used for managing the state and handling side effects like fetching data.
Real-Time Features: Some components, such as the Notes app, may be enhanced with real-time capabilities using libraries like Socket.io (future enhancement).
Responsive Design: The app is built with responsiveness in mind, using Tailwind CSS to ensure a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Future Enhancements
Advanced User Roles: Support for multiple user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) with different permissions.
Real-Time Updates: Integrating real-time features for collaborative tasks and shared notes.
API Integrations: Integration with external APIs for more features, such as advanced weather forecasts or financial tracking.
